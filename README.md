## 🚀 Overview

**Solo Scheduler** is a gamified productivity app inspired by Solo Leveling that aims to transform mundane daily tasks into exciting quests. The app uses traditional RPG elements like levels, experience points (EXP), stats, skills, items and more to provide visually appealing and engaging markers of progression, thereby instilling a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment in users. This in turn motivates users to take control of their lives, boosting productivity and cutting down on digital procrastination.

## 🎯 Motivation

The rise of TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels has contributed to attention fragmentation and dopamine-driven distractions. Solo Scheduler offers a fun and focused alternative that rewards productivity and discourages endless scrolling.

1. **Daily Quests**
- Users can add, delete, edit, and mark quests as complete or incomplete.
- Completing a quest grants 100 EXP.
- All changes to quests and EXP are instantly reflected across all pages.
- Quest data and EXP are saved and persist across page changes and new sessions.

2. **Passive Dungeons**
- Users select a duration to enter the dungeon. When the chosen time elapses or the user quits, they receive EXP based on the time spent.
- For testing, dungeon time is measured in seconds (not minutes).
- 100 EXP is awarded for every 2 seconds spent in the dungeon.

3. **Active Dungeons**
- Users control their character with WASD keys to move and left-click to attack.
- The current control scheme is for testing. In the final mobile version, attacks will be automated by the character’s AI, and movement will be controlled via an on-screen joystick.
